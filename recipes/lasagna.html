        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion <em>finely chopped</em></li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic <em>finely minced</em></li>
        <li>400g vegan mince <em>e.g Beyond Meat</em></li>
        <li>1 celery stalk <em>finely diced</em></li>
        <li>1 carrot <em>finely diced</em></li>
        <li>400g can peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>200ml vegetable stock</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Condiments, spices and extra</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato puree</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon marmite</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
        <li>100ml dry white wine</li>
        <li>sea salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>120g vegan cheese</li>
        <li>fresh parsley or basil</li>
        <li>12 lasagna sheets</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="instructions">Instructions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a wide frying pan or a low-sided saucepan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once it's heated, introduce the onion and sauté for approximately 2 minutes until it becomes tender. Add the garlic and continue to sauté for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the vegan mince into the pan, breaking it up with a spatula. Continue to sauté for a few more minutes until the vegan mince begins to brown. Add the carrot and celery to the mix, along with a splash of water to deglaze the pan. Cook for an additional 2 minutes or until the carrots and celery start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the dried herbs, tomato puree, marmite, light soy sauce, dry white wine, canned peeled tomatoes, and vegetable stock. Use the spatula to break up the tomatoes, then let the sauce come to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Once it's simmering, reduce the heat and allow the sauce to cook for approximately 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegan mince from burning. Taste the sauce and season with sea salt and black pepper as desired.</li>
        <li>If the lasagna sheets you're using require pre-cooking, do so in a large saucepan of salted boiling water. However, cook the pasta for only half of the time stated on the packaging.</li>
        <li>In a 22x33cm or 9x13 inch casserole or lasagna dish, spoon a thin layer of the vegan ragu onto the base. Spread it evenly and then arrange a layer of pasta sheets. Top this with a layer of bechamel sauce, followed by another layer of pasta sheets. Repeat this layering process until all the ragu has been used up. Finish with a final layer of pasta, topped by a final layer of bechamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Wrap the lasagna in aluminum foil and place it in the oven to bake for 30 minutes. Afterward, remove it from the oven, take off the foil, and if you're using vegan cheese, sprinkle it on top. Return the lasagna to the oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and allow it to rest for 15 minutes before garnishing with fresh parsley or basil and serving. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
